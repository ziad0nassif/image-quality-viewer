Image Viewer Application
This project is a simple image viewer application built with Python and PyQt5, designed to load and display images using a user-friendly graphical interface. It supports opening images, zooming, and provides a file dialog for selecting image files from the system.

Introduction
The Image Viewer Application allows users to open, view, and zoom in or out on image files. It provides a straightforward interface to navigate through directories and select images for viewing. The user can adjust the zoom to view the image in different scales. This project is a great example of using PyQt5 to create desktop GUI applications in Python.

Features
Open Images: Select and open image files using a file dialog.
Zoom In/Out: Zoom in or out on the displayed image for a better view.
User-friendly Interface: A simple and clean interface using PyQt5 for smooth user interactions.
File Dialog: Easily select image files from your system using the file explorer.
Requirements
To run this application, make sure the following are installed:

Python 3.x (Python 3.6 or newer recommended)
PyQt5 (for the graphical user interface)
Pillow (for image processing)
You can install the necessary dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install PyQt5 pillow
How to Start
Clone the repository or download the project files.
Navigate to the project directory where the Python file is located.
Run the application by executing the following command:
bash
Copy code
python image_viewer.py
The application window will open, allowing you to select and view images.
Usage
Upon running the application, you can use the "Open" button to choose an image from your system.
Use the zoom buttons (Zoom In/Zoom Out) to adjust the image size.
The image will be displayed at the selected scale, and you can easily navigate through the zoomed-in image.
Logging and Debugging
If any errors occur while running the application, check the Python terminal/command line window for logging output. In case of file issues, ensure that the images you try to open are in supported formats (such as .jpg, .png, etc.).

Example Log:
lua
Copy code
Error: Invalid file format. Please select a valid image file.
